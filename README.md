# Surveillance System Kata

We want to create a Surveillance System that records video when something is detected. We have purchased two devices:

- A sensor that will be able to send us an event when starts detecting, and another event when stops detecting.
- A video recorder that we can invoke via API to start and stop recording.

Test and implement the necessary code for making those components interact.
